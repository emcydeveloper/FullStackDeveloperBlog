            So you’ve heard of frontend and backend development and what they
            involve, but what is a full-stack developer, what do they do, and
            why are they so in-demand? This guide will clear it all up for you.

            In this post, I’m going to be giving you both the wider scope and
            some of the details of what this sought-after job entails and my
            experiences within the field. Hopefully by then, that should answer
            that sticky-note question for both novices and more experienced
            coders alike. Essentially, we’re going to learn what is a full-stack
            developer, and how you can become one.

          <h1>1. What is t-shaped developer?</h1>
          <p>
            The T-shaped model is a concept that has been around for a while
            that describes the abilities or characteristics of an individual. An
            ideal T-shaped person has many generalized skills, with a
            specialization in one or a few specific fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            A full-stack web developer is an excellent example of this model, as
            the developer has general knowledge across a wide breadth of
            technologies and platforms as well as in-depth experience and
            specialization in a couple of those concepts. For the most part,
            there are two general fields that make up a full-stack developer’s
            skillset: frontend development and backend development.

          <h1>2. What is frontend web development?</h1>
          <p>
            This skillset involves the actual presentation of your website—how
            the information in your website is laid out in browsers and on
            mobile devices as well. A dedicated frontend developer will be very
            experienced working with HTML and CSS, as well as the scripting
            language JavaScript. With these languages, the developer can very
            efficiently manipulate the information on a website to make it
            appealing and effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything that you actually see on a website—the layout, the
            positioning of text and images, colors, fonts, buttons, and so
            on—are all factors that the frontend developer must consider.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main goal of a frontend developer is to
            <strong>provide the platform for visitors to interact with</strong>,
            a platform which provides and receives information. This means some
            developers will be well-versed in web design and using software such
            as Photoshop and Illustrator to create graphics and themed layouts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additional skillsets of a frontend developer could include user
            experience design and user interface design, skills which help a
            team evaluate the best methods of displaying and collecting
            information. A frontend developer who possesses these design skills
            is potentially more valuable as they can identify the look and feel
            of a site while assessing the technical capabilities of such a
            design at the same time.

          <h1>3. What is backend web development?</h1>
          <p>
            Creation, edit/update, and collection of data are some of the
            processes that are most often associated with backend development.
            Some examples of common scripting languages used are
            <strong>PHP, Ruby</strong>, and the most popular these days,
            <strong><u>Python</u></strong
            >. With these languages, a backend developer can create algorithms
            and business logic to manipulate the data that was received in
            frontend development.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means that a backend developer must be able to write code to
            receive the information input from the user and also save it
            somewhere–like in a database. There are two main types of databases:
            <strong>relational</strong> (like PostgreSQL and MySQL) and
            <strong>non-relational</strong> management systems (like Mongo). The
            language used for database management is SQL, which helps the
            developer interact with the database.
          </p>
          <p>
            The concepts might sound foreign, but just understand that there are
            different database management systems based on convenience and use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another component of backend development is
            <strong>server management</strong>, which are applications that host
            the database and serve up the website. An alternative to knowing how
            to manage servers is to use
            <strong>cloud-based platforms</strong> that provide the
            infrastructure, like Heroku or Amazon Web Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding server management allows a developer to troubleshoot
            slow applications and even determine how scalable their websites are
            to include more users.

          <h1>4. What is a full-stack web developer?</h1>
          <p>
            Full-stack developers are experts in both the frontend and backend;
            so, the full-stack of technology that makes up a website. They are
            proficient in both frontend and backend languages and frameworks, as
            well as in server, network and hosting environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get to this breadth and depth of knowledge, most full-stack
            developers will have spent many years working in a variety of
            different roles. They also tend to be well-versed in both business
            logic and user experience, meaning they are not only well-equipped
            to get hands on, but can also guide and consult on strategy too.

          <h1>5. Why become a full-stack web developer?</h1>
          <p>
            Given the choice to specialize in frontend or backend development,
            why would any developer choose to learn the full spectrum?
          </p>
          <p>
            It goes back to the value of being a T-shaped person. You are more
            valuable to a team when you are able to address and discuss both
            aspects of the web development process and bridge the disconnect.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, one developer who can readily assess and communicate
            how a website should look, feel, and manipulate data while
            understanding the technical limitations of such implementations will
            be a respected and valuable member of any team or company.

          <h1>6. Conclusion</h1>
          <p>
            There are many resources available to learn about full-stack web
            development. Google the phrase “become a full-stack developer” and
            you will get pages and pages of different venues and methods to
            learn. But you’re probably at the start of the journey and don’t
            feel like you have the knowledge to differentiate between the
            self-guides, YouTube videos, bootcamps, and online courses.
          </p>
          <p>
            A good first tip is to review the resources based on a criteria of
            the topics mentioned in this article. Ask yourself questions like:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>How much frontend development is involved?</li>
            <li>What will I learn for backend development?</li>
            <li>What programming languages and frameworks are being taught?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A full-stack developer has all the keys to the house–there is no
            door that you cannot open. It provides an unparalleled freedom to
            simultaneously work on frontend and backend development and evaluate
            the capabilities and potential of your website in real-time without
            having to wait for another developer to review if what you’re
            desiring is possible or not.
